Agile Engine test stuff

Greetings! 

In all honesty, I don't have the skills to finish this task in under 4 hours.

I had minor technical issues and errands to run on the side as the clock was already ticking, but even without those I don't see myself delivering the required solution in under 4 hours.
Furthermore, I ran out of free time I am willing to spend on this task, seeing as this is my day-off.

Here is what I managed to complete in a bit under 3 hours of development. As you can see, it isn't much. Things would have probably been much better have I tried to use WebClient or any other existing implementation for token management instead of trying to design my own system to persist and refresh tokens from scratch.

The plan was to use an in-memory H2 DB so that one could just launch the app as mvn clean install + mvn spring-boot: run. That being said, current functionality is only a test controller with call for authentication, I didn't get around to implementing the rest.

The good news is that this is around the level of performance I was expecting from myself. The bad news is that it seems like this level isn't sufficient for your company.

I participated mainly to see where I stand after 2 years of "degradation" on a huge e-commerce platform with routine tasks and no self-improvement on the side.
This showed me that I need to brush up and practice my non-Hybris skills and prepare for interviews before I attempt such activities.

I will attempt to push against my current employer on workday regulations. The goal is to establish at least a bit of time when I don't feel too exhausted to work on improving my skills. Having an actual 8-hour workday instead of ~10-12 would be a nice start... 

Hopefully if I have time next weekends I will work on this challenging task of yours some more, purely for myself.

Sorry for having taken your time, have a great day!
